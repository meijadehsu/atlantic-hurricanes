            categorizes (rates) hurricanes by strength based on wind speed.
            <ul>
                <li>The weakest "hurricanes" are
                    <b><span style="color: darkgreen">tropical depressions</span></b>.
                    They have wind speeds of less than or equal to <b>38 mph</b>. Tropical depressions are the
                    <b><span style="color: darkgreen">dark green </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li>Above tropical depressions are
                    <b><span style="color: limegreen">tropical storms</span></b>. They have wind speeds between
                    <b>39-73 mph</b>. Tropical storms are the
                    <b><span style="color: limegreen">lime green </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li>Next are
                    <b><span style="color: gold">Category 1</span></b> hurricanes. They have wind speeds between
                    <b>74-95 mph</b>. Category 1 hurricanes are the
                    <b><span style="color: gold">gold </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li>Above Category 1 hurricanes are
                    <b><span style="color: darkorange">Category 2</span></b> hurricanes. They have wind speeds
                    between <b>96-110 mph</b>. Category 2 hurricanes are the
                    <b><span style="color: darkorange">dark orange </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li><b><span style="color: hotpink">Category 3</span></b> hurricanes have wind speeds between
                    <b>111-129 mph</b>. Category 3 hurricanes are the
                    <b><span style="color: hotpink">hot pink </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li><b><span style="color: red">Category 4</span></b> hurricanes have wind speeds between
                    <b>130-156 mph</b>. Category 4 hurricanes are the
                    <b><span style="color: red">red </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
                <li>The very strongest hurricanes are
                    <b><span style="color: darkblue">Category 5</span></b> hurricanes. These rare beasts have
                    wind speeds at or above <b>157 mph</b>. The strongest Category 5 hurricanes have been known
                    to reach wind speeds of almost <b>200 mph</b>. Category 5 hurricanes are the
                    <b><span style="color: darkblue">dark blue </span></b>
                    dots on the chart.
                </li>
            </ul>
            From this chart, in addition to the wind speed ranges for each of the hurricane categories, we can
            see a <b>strong, negative, linear correlation between the air (atmospheric) pressure at the storm's
            center and the storm's wind speed</b>. There are scientific reasons why this is: Wind is partially
            caused by differences in atmospheric pressure. The lower the pressure at a point on Earth, the
            higher the differences between the pressure there and the pressures around it, creating a steeper
            pressure gradient and thus faster wind.

          <p>To illustrate the relationships between storm category, air pressure, and wind speed, we plot the relationship between these variables below. The first plot shows the average air pressure recorded in millibars for each storm category while the second plot shows the average wind speed in miles per hour (calculated by converting the wind speed given in knots) for each storm category. We find that stronger storms (by category) have lower air pressure than weaker storms on average, indicating an inverse relationship between the two attributes. The lowest average air pressure of ~920 millibars is recorded for category 5 hurricanes, lower than the average pressure at sea level of ~1013 millibars. Additionally, we find that stronger storms (by category) have higher wind speeds than weaker storms on average. Category 5 hurricanes have the highest average wind speeds recorded at ~161mph (140 knots).

        <!-- Storms per Year -->
        <div id="storms_per_year">
            <p>A popular question in hurricane science is, "Have hurricanes been getting more frequent over time?"
                Our analysis shows that <b>hurricanes have not been getting more frequent over time</b>. Here is a
                chart of the number of storms (tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) each year from
                1975-2020. While it may seem that storms were rare in the 70s, this is because multiple years in the
                70s had missing data. For example, according to the chart, which plots the data from the data set,
                there were only 3 storms in 1975. However, in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Atlantic_hurricane_season">real life</a>,
                there were 23 storms in 1975. This means that the data is biased due to underreporting of storms in
                some years of the data set.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, while there may appear to be a spike in the number of storms on the far right of the
                chart, this is due to the 2020 hurricane season, which had the most number of storms on record. The
                2021 season (which is not in our data set, but for which there is data
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Atlantic_hurricane_season">online</a>)
                had 21 storms, which would have caused the line to come back down from its peak in 2020.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, given underreporting of storms in some years and the lack of a sustained increase in the number
                of storms per year, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to prove that hurricanes have been
                getting more frequent over time.

    <p>The dynamic visualization below plots the location of all Atlantic storms (tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes) occurring between 1975 to 2020 grouped by the month in which each storm occurred. The path of each storm is plotted using the geolocation recorded over the course of 6 hour intervals and the paths of all storms that occurred in a given month over this period are all plotted together. The shade of each point encodes the category of the storm with the least powerful storms (tropical depressions) appearing in a light shade and the most powerful storms (category 5 hurricanes) appearing in a dark shade. Additionally, the diameter of each circle is directly proportional to the diameter of tropical-storm-force winds recorded for the storm. The user can zoom in or out of the map and drag it to a location of interest or slide the moving bar above the visualization to better understand local impacts of storms on a month-to-month basis.
    </p>
    <p>From this visualization, we can gather several insights. First, by moving the monthly slider above the visualization, we can see that storms are few in number in the beginning of the year from January to June (with no storms recorded in the months of February and March), rise to a peak in September, and decrease over the remaining months of the year. Additionally, it is clear that the frequency of strong storms both in terms of size (the diameter of tropical-storm-force winds) and in terms of category peaks from August to October, the late summer and early autumn months. A higher number of storms also make landfall in the United States in these exact same months. By following the trajectory of individual storms, we can also see that a high percentage of storms originate off the coast of West Africa and from the Caribbean, travel west, and curve up towards the Gulf of Mexico or along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. None of the recorded storms ever make contact with Africa or Europe, and very few storms have made contact with South America.
